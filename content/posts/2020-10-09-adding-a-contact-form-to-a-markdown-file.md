This site is hosted on Netlify. I was trying to implement the convenient Netlify form handling feature so I could add a simple contact form to this site. I'm new to markdown, so I did a little research about what can go into a markdown file. I learned that you can add HTML to markdown files which is how I was able to make it work! 

I also found out that you can add MDX to a Gatsby site which is a way to include React Components in markdown files. This isn't something I need to do here at the moment, but it opens up a whole new set of questions and ideas for other projects.
