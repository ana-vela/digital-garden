As I've been helping maintain an open source project, I've been using Git Kraken to keep track of branches and changes. This is working well for me, but I also want to learn more about how to do all this through the command line. I have some notes on this, but I still have a few commands I need to learn. Once I can get a good process, I'll create a git guide for maintaining open source projects.
