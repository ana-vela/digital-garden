Hacktoberfest began today which means people were busy trying to make pull requests on GitHub. Since I am helping maintain an open source project for beginners, I worked on bringing down the number of pull requests. We did receive a few spam PRs, but it was manageable.

I also published another blog post on Hashnode. This was a good accomplishment since I have not been consistent with my writing. Hashnode has done a great job of creating an inclusive community that makes it a joy to publish posts and interact with other developers on the platform.
