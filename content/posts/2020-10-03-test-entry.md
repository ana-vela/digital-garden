Finally got to 3/4 of the way done with the 100 days of code challenge! This is a great feeling to keep progressing and sticking with this commitment. After the challenge is over, I feel like I'll continue to keep this coding habit!

Today I met with dev partner about the translator app. We are close to getting the functionality working. I've been working on improving the styling of the app with React Bootstrap. It's been fun experimenting with CSS.
