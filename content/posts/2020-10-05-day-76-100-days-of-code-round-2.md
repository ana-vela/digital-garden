Last night, I began getting this site up. I've been wanting to create a site that is not quite a blog, but a place where I can add notes, lists, a log of my current learnings, and more. I decided to use Gatsby since it is a framework I am familiar with. I went with a minimal starter that I could connect to Netlify CMS. After some changes and setup, I have my digital garden ready! I didn't have a concrete plan for the structure of this project, so I'll be experimenting as I go. And now I will add an update.
