I spent some time perusing GitHub repost for Hacktoberfest projects to work on. There are plenty of projects, but it can get overwhelming to look through each one to find something I can work on. Some projects have issues already listed which makes it much easier to jump in and help. One approach I think will help is contacting the repo owners to ask if there is anything they'd like help with. I did contact one person whose repo I am familiar with and I like, but it isn't a Hacktoberfest labeled project. In the long run, I figure it's more important to contribute to something I use and am familiar with.
